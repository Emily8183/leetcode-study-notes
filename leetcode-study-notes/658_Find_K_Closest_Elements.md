**Key Points**:
Binary Search + Sliding Window

**Tips**:

1. Define the intervals for both binary search and sliding window. Do you want your intervals to be left-open, right-open, or open on both sides?
2. Edge case: if arr.length == k
3. Again, here's an additional test case (which I spent most of my time to solve): arr = [1,1,1,10,10,10], k = 1, x = 9
