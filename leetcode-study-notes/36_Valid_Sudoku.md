ðŸ“Œ Comparison between Java and Python:

In Java, if a duplicate element is added to a HashSet, it will return false.

In Python, the set.add() method does not return True or False, but you can achieve the same effect by using the **in** operator.

**Example:**

seen = set()

1. Check if f"{num}" is not in the set

2. Alternatively:

if f"{num} in row {i}" in seen: # Perform some action
Additionally, f"..." is a formatted string (f-string) in Python, similar to Template Literals in JavaScript.

For Java, as I researched, you can use String.format() as an alternative for formatting.
